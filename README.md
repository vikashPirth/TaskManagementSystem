# TaskManagementSystem
Backend Requirements:

FastAPI: A modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python.
SQLAlchemy: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
Pydantic: For data validation and serialization.
PostgreSQL: As the database to store task data, user data, and authentication details.
Frontend Requirements (Optional):

You can choose to build a frontend for the Task Management System to provide a user interface for creating and managing tasks. Some frontend technologies you may consider are:
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Angular: A full-featured framework for building complex frontend applications.
Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
Docker Requirements:

Docker: To containerize the FastAPI application and database for easy deployment and scaling.
Docker Compose (Optional but recommended): To define and manage multi-container Docker applications, including the FastAPI app and PostgreSQL database.
Kubernetes Requirements:

Kubernetes: To manage containerized applications and provide scalability and high availability.
kubectl: The Kubernetes command-line tool to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
Minikube (Optional for local development): To run Kubernetes locally on a single node for development and testing purposes.
Authentication and Authorization (Optional):

OAuth2: For securing the API and implementing user authentication.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): To issue and manage tokens for API authentication and authorization.
Testing and Documentation:

Pytest: For writing unit tests and integration tests for the backend application.
Swagger/OpenAPI: To generate API documentation automatically from FastAPI endpoints.
Additional Libraries (Optional):

Celery: For handling background tasks or task scheduling.
Redis: As a message broker for Celery (if using Celery).
Gunicorn: As a production-grade WSGI server to run the FastAPI application.
Remember that this is just a basic list of requirements to get you started. Depending on the complexity and specific features you want to implement in the Task Management System, you may need to add more libraries and tools to fulfill the project's needs.

Once you have a clear list of requirements, you can start setting up the project, building the backend with FastAPI and PostgreSQL, creating the frontend (if desired), containerizing the application with Docker, and deploying it with Kubernetes. Happy coding!

### Business Requirements 

User Registration and Authentication:

Users should be able to register accounts with the system.
Implement user authentication using OAuth2 or JWT.
Secure user credentials and sensitive data.
Task Creation:

Authenticated users can create new tasks.
Each task should have a title, description, due date, and assignee (optional).
Implement data validation to ensure required fields are provided.
Task Assignment:

Allow task assignees to be specified during task creation.
An assignee can be a specific user or a team.
Only authorized users should be able to assign tasks to others.
Task Tracking and Status:

Users should be able to view all tasks assigned to them.
The status of each task should be tracked (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").
Allow users to update task status as they work on them.
Task Filtering and Sorting:

Enable users to filter tasks based on criteria like status, due date, or assignee.
Implement sorting options to order tasks based on priority, due date, etc.
Task Updates and Comments:

Allow users to add updates and comments to tasks.
Updates should include a timestamp and description of the changes made.
Comments should allow for threaded discussions.
Task Notifications:

Implement a notification system to alert assignees when tasks are assigned or updated.
Users should receive notifications via email or in-app notifications.
Search Functionality:

Provide a search feature to find tasks based on keywords or tags.
User Profile and Preferences:

Users should be able to view and edit their profiles.
Allow users to set preferences for notifications, default task views, etc.
Security and Authorization:

Ensure that users can only access and modify tasks they are authorized for.
Admin users may have additional privileges, such as task assignment to any user.
Data Export and Reporting (Optional):

Allow users to export task data to CSV or PDF formats.
Provide basic reporting features to analyze task completion and team performance.
Error Handling and Logging:

Implement proper error handling and logging for the backend and frontend.
Display meaningful error messages to users when something goes wrong.
Unit and Integration Testing:

Write unit tests to test the functionality of individual components.
Perform integration testing to ensure the system works as a whole.
API Documentation:

Generate API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.
Document API endpoints, request/response models, and authentication requirements.
